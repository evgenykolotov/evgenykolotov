### Hi there!!👋

I'm **Evgeny Kolotov**. I work as a full-time software engineer. In my spare time I do open-sourcing (normally it is about 1-2 hours in the morning before the work).
Most of my open-source projects below 👇🏻 are focused on one thing - **to help people learn** 📚📚.
You may use these projects to learn about algorithms in **TypeScript** and get prepared for technical interviews.
